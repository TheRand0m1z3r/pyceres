# pyceres - a Python wrapper for Google Ceres

This package is a Python wrapper for the Google Ceres solver library.

## Current State
This package is in a pre-alpha state, and is mostly used for the development of [D+](https://bitbucket.org/uriraviv/public-dplus/src/master/)

We will make this package more comprehensive, and include proper documentation when it's more mature.
