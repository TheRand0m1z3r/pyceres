# dplus_ceres - a Python wrapper for Google Ceres for DPlus

This package is a Python wrapper for the Google Ceres solver library - for DPlus
It is based on the pre-existing work from the [Cyres library](https://github.com/rll/cyres)

NOTE: It was originally called pyceres, but since it is too tied with DPlus, we renamed it so there is no confusion.
## Current State
This package is in beta state, along with D+
## Current versions
Eigen 3.4.0, ceres 2.0
