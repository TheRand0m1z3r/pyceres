1. download ceres (version 2.0.0) and eigen (version 2.4.0)
(commit to repo)
2. make dirs eigen-bin and ceres-bin
3. cmake eigen:
        cd eigen-bin
        cmake ..\eigen -DCMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM=x64
4. cmake ceres:
        cd ceres-bin
        cmake ..\ceres -DCMAKE_GENERATOR_PLATFORM=x64 -DMINIGLOG=ON -DEIGEN_INCLUDE_DIR_HINTS="..\eigen"
5. if windows, ceres-bin/internal/ceres will now include ceres.vcxproj
  
OPTIONAL:
   this is written in a super stupid way with hardcoded paths for everything.
   the hardcoded paths to the ceres folder can be replaced with $(ProjectDir)
   The OutDirs with hardcoded paths to ceres-bin can be replaced with $(SolutionDir)$(Platform)\$(Configuration)\ 
   there is also a section of code runing to check cmake (a custom build command around 52 lines long including 12 hardcoded paths). 
   It had hardcoded paths to where cmake was installed, etc. I can be deleted entirely. 

6. open the vcxproj and build it **in release mode**. You only need to build ceres, not the other projects. This will take forever, because ceres. The built file will be in ceres-bin/lib/Release
